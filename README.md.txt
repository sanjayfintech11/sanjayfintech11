My Projects

#### Exploratory Data Analysis of 3+ Million Used cars Dataset : Link Blog

• Cleaned data for 3+ million containing 66 columns and analyzed data by taking a sample of 250,000 rows with 17 columns using Pandas.

• Created visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, geo heatmaps, etc.) using Seaborn & Plotly.

• Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet have the most number of listings in the market and the car with the most listings has SUV/Crossover body type.

#### Web Scrapping of the Crypto Website: Link Blog

• Scraped Cryptocompare Website. We used Python, libraries such as Requests, Selenium, and Pandas to extract the details for this project.

• The project scrapes the list of 100 cryptocurrencies from each tab of the page and provides details like Rank, Name, URL and Price in USD, Market cap, Volume, and Rating.

• Parsed all the scraped data into a data frame and hence stored it in a CSV file containing 277 rows and 11 columns.
